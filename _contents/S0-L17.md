Despite the ability to train capable LLMs, the methodology for maintaining their relevancy and rectifying errors remains elusive. To this end, the past few years have witnessed a surge in techniques for editing LLMs, the objective of which is to efficiently alter the behavior of LLMs within a specific domain without negatively impacting performance across other inputs. This paper embarks on a deep exploration of the problems, methods, and opportunities related to model editing for LLMs. In particular, we provide an exhaustive overview of the task definition and challenges associated with model editing, along with an in-depth empirical analysis of the most progressive methods currently at our disposal. We also build a new benchmark dataset to facilitate a more robust evaluation and pinpoint enduring issues intrinsic to existing techniques. Our objective is to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and feasibility of each editing technique, thereby assisting the community in making informed decisions on the selection of the most appropriate method for a specific task or context.

### Tuning Language Models by Proxy
+ Alisa Liu, Xiaochuang Han, Yizhong Wang, Yulia Tsvetkov, Yejin Choi, Noah A. Smith
+ Submitted on 16 Jan 2024]
+ Despite the general capabilities of large pretrained language models, they consistently benefit from further adaptation to better achieve desired behaviors. However, tuning these models has become increasingly resource-intensive, or impossible when model weights are private. We introduce proxy-tuning, a lightweight decoding-time algorithm that operates on top of black-box LMs to achieve the result of directly tuning the model, but by accessing only its prediction over the output vocabulary. Our method instead tunes a smaller LM, then applies the difference between the predictions of the small tuned and untuned LMs to shift the original predictions of the base model in the direction of tuning, while retaining the benefits of larger scale pretraining. In experiments, when we apply proxy-tuning to Llama2-70B using proxies of only 7B size, we can close 88% of the gap between Llama2-70B and its truly-tuned chat version, when evaluated across knowledge, reasoning, and safety benchmarks. Interestingly, when tested on TruthfulQA, proxy-tuned models are actually more truthful than directly tuned models, possibly because decoding-time guidance better retains the model's factual knowledge. We then demonstrate the generality of proxy-tuning by applying it for domain adaptation on code, and task-specific finetuning on question-answering and math problems. Our work demonstrates the promise of using small tuned LMs to efficiently customize large, potentially proprietary LMs through decoding-time guidance.



### A Survey of Machine Unlearning
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02299
  + Today, computer systems hold large amounts of personal data. Yet while such an abundance of data allows breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, and especially machine learning (ML), its existence can be a threat to user privacy, and it can weaken the bonds of trust between humans and AI. Recent regulations now require that, on request, private information about a user must be removed from both computer systems and from ML models, i.e. ``the right to be forgotten''). While removing data from back-end databases should be straightforward, it is not sufficient in the AI context as ML models often `remember' the old data. Contemporary adversarial attacks on trained models have proven that we can learn whether an instance or an attribute belonged to the training data. This phenomenon calls for a new paradigm, namely machine unlearning, to make ML models forget about particular data. It turns out that recent works on machine unlearning have not been able to completely solve the problem due to the lack of common frameworks and resources. Therefore, this paper aspires to present a comprehensive examination of machine unlearning's concepts, scenarios, methods, and applications. Specifically, as a category collection of cutting-edge studies, the intention behind this article is to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking an introduction to machine unlearning and its formulations, design criteria, removal requests, algorithms, and applications. In addition, we aim to highlight the key findings, current trends, and new research areas that have not yet featured the use of machine unlearning but could benefit greatly from it. We hope this survey serves as a valuable resource for ML researchers and those seeking to innovate privacy technologies. Our resources are publicly available at this https URL.



### AI Model Disgorgement: Methods and Choices
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03545
  + Alessandro Achille, Michael Kearns, Carson Klingenberg, Stefano Soatto
Responsible use of data is an indispensable part of any machine learning (ML) implementation. ML developers must carefully collect and curate their datasets, and document their provenance. They must also make sure to respect intellectual property rights, preserve individual privacy, and use data in an ethical way. Over the past few years, ML models have significantly increased in size and complexity. These models require a very large amount of data and compute capacity to train, to the extent that any defects in the training corpus cannot be trivially remedied by retraining the model from scratch. Despite sophisticated controls on training data and a significant amount of effort dedicated to ensuring that training corpora are properly composed, the sheer volume of data required for the models makes it challenging to manually inspect each datum comprising a training corpus. One potential fix for training corpus data defects is model disgorgement -- the elimination of not just the improperly used data, but also the effects of improperly used data on any component of an ML model. Model disgorgement techniques can be used to address a wide range of issues, such as reducing bias or toxicity, increasing fidelity, and ensuring responsible usage of intellectual property. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy of possible disgorgement methods that are applicable to modern ML systems. In particular, we investigate the meaning of "removing the effects" of data in the trained model in a way that does not require retraining from scratch.

### Outline
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide2.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">

- The presenters discussed 3 primary topics:
1. Editing Large Language Models
2. Tuning Language Models by Proxy
3. A survey of Machine Unlearning

## Paper 1: Editing Large Language Models
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide3.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">

### Context
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide5.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
As is visible from the graph, LLMs have seen a meteoric rise in recent times. This graph relates the number of parameters in models to time, by year since 2020. It also shows which models are available with open access, and shows larger circles for models with more parameters. 

### Unwanted Knowledge
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide6.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
LLMs can easily learn unwanted knowledge. If given poor input data, it can output biased responses. The authors will discuss if there is an efficient way for large language models to update their knowledge.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide7.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
Editing LLMs is necessary because the world changes after they are released. Labels shift, and the ground truth for their answers can shift as well. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide8.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
The authors discuss 3 primary ways of updating a model:
1. Fine-tuning: drawbacks include its computational requirements and how easy it is to overfit.
2. Retrieval augmented: can scale poorly and suffer from retrieval noise
3. Model editing: gives precise control, but can be difficult and ineffective.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide9.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
In this slide the presenters formally describe the task at hand. The goal is to modify a model's behavior for one particular edit descriptor while leaving other behaviors unchanged. The edit scope is also formally defined with *S*, and behaviors can either be in-scope or out-of-scope. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide10.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
For evaluation, the authors primarily use metrics of reliability, generalization, and locality.

#### Current Methods
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide12.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
This slide shows how current methods could be used to modify an edit descriptor in a model. The upper section shows a method to modify the behavior while preserving the model's parameters. The lower section shows a method wherein the model's parameters are modified. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide13.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
The authors present this table to compare the current methods and specify additional attributes of their approaches. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide15.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
The authors now experiment with the different approaches. Their experiments are based on factual knowledge, which is information that can be verified as true or false based on empirical evidence or authoritative sources. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide16.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
The authors will utilize the CounterFact dataset to measure the efficacy of significant changes. This slide also shows the composition of that dataset.

#### Experimental Results
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide17.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
This slide shows the results of existing methods on three metrics of the dataset: reliability, generalization, and locality. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide18.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
In terms of scaling, the authors note that the ROME and MEMEIT approaches perform well on the GPT-NEOX-20B model but fail on OPT-13B. They note that large amounts of matrix computations and in-context learning ability could limit the efficacy of certain approaches. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/Slide19.PNG" width="80%" height="80%">
Batch editing is required to modify a model with multiple knowledge pieces simultaneously. Some methods are batch-editing-supportive. Figure 3 shows batch editing performance vs. batch number. MEMEIT appears to be one of the best approaches in this regard. 

#### General Results

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/gr.png" width="80%" height="80%">

Different models are tested on GSM and AlpacaFarm datasets. The results show that while
both Base and 70B-Base models are struggling, the proxy-tuned 70B-Base model has drastic improvement in performance
as well as generating less toxic responses.

#### TruthfulQA Detailed Results

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/truth.png" width="80%" height="80%">

The models are also tested on Truthful QA dataset, which has two aspects, truthfulness and informativeness. 
Truthfulness is a measurement on answer to question does not assert a false statement. (does not give any 
factually incorrect answer) while informativeness is a measurement on provided information that reduces uncertainty 
raised by question.

It shows that the proxy-tuned models are more truthful though slightly less informative which implies  decoding-time 
algorithms may preserve knowledge better than direct finetuning.

#### Code Adaptation Experiments

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/ca1.png" width="80%" height="80%">

The authors also test the proxy-tuning on code adaptation. They used Codellama-7B-python as the base model and compared
the results with proxy-tuning again direct tuning. The evaluation datasets are CodexEval and DS-1000.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/ca2.png" width="80%" height="80%">

The results show that the proxy-tuned model does not outperform the directly tuned model on code adaptation. The authors 
deduced that it can be due to that the base model itself is already tuned on a specific task and that Proxy-tuning needs 
more work for code generation applications.

#### Task Finetuning Experiments

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/tf.png" width="80%" height="80%">

LMs usually do not perform ideally on out-of-the-box tasks. The authors test the proxy-tuning on two tasks which requires 
some sort of tuning. The datasets are TriviaQA and GSM, one is a question-answering task and the other is a math question 
task. The models are LLAMA2-7B finetuned on trainset to obtain a task expert. Anti expert is another LLAMA2-7B model.

The results show that the proxy-tuned model does not outperform the directly tuned model on both datasets.

#### Analysis of proxy tuning at the token level

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/tl1.png" width="80%" height="80%">

To understand what kinds of tokens are influenced more by proxy-tuning, the authors recorded next-token 
probability distribution at each time step and then took the difference in probabilities assigned to the 
top token xt chosen by the proxy-tuned model. The analysis is based on 12B-Base and its proxy-tuned model.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/tl2.png" width="80%" height="80%">

For GSM, all the intermediate equations' left-hand side and the right-hand side are compared to the references where 
there is a single correct answer. the probability difference is 0.130 on average for LHS tokens, 
and 0.056 for RHS tokens, a difference which is statistically significant with p < 0.0001 under a t-test.

It shows that proxy tuning contributes more to formulating reasoning steps than to generating factual statements.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/tl3.png" width="80%" height="80%">

For TruthfulQA, the authors recorded the tokens most influenced by proxy tuning. It shows that instruction tuning 
mainly influences reasoning and style instead of increasing the model’s knowledge as can be seen in the two 
examples, where the changes are more of stylistic nature.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/tl4.png" width="80%" height="80%">

To study if hyperparameters can provide more control over proxy tuning, especially in terms of the 
trade-off between informativeness and truthfulness. The authors used TruthfulQA dataset as the example, and the 
hyperparameter α is between 0.2 and 2, the larger it is the more contrast there is between the expert and
anti-expert.

It shows that the informativeness decreases as α increases, while the truthfulness increases. There is
some optimum value existing for a specific dataset.

#### Conclusion

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/con.png" width="80%" height="80%">

The authors concluded that proxy-tuning is a promising method for the decoding-time by modifying output logits, an 
efficient alternative to direct finetuning and a viable method to fine-tuning proprietary models.

As full finetuning might lead to forgetting old information, proxy tuning might open a new method of continual 
learning since it is more efficient.

### A Survey of Machine Unlearning

#### "The Right to be Forgotten"

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/right.png" width="80%" height="80%">

It can be argued that everyone should have “The right to have private information about a person be removed from Internet searches and other 
directories under some circumstances”. As individuals tend to change and develop throughout the time and events from the 
past can still cause stigma and consequences even many years later when the person has changed or the information is no longer
relevant or true.

#### Machine Unlearning

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/mu.png" width="80%" height="80%">

This concept should also be applied to machine learning models. As models are tend to be trained on past data, the 
information that should be unlearned is both in the dataset and the model's parameters. Thus this poses a question
of how to unlearn the data from the model.


#### Reasons for Machine Unlearning

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/reasons.png" width="80%" height="80%">

There are several reasons of why machine unlearning can be beneficial: 1. Improve security of the Model; 2. Improve 
privacy of User; 3. Improve Usability of System and 4. Reduce Bias in the Model.

#### Machine Unlearning Challenges

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/chall.png" width="80%" height="80%">

There are also some challenges in machine unlearning: 1. As a model is trained on mini-batches, it is hard to 
find all the batches that contain the data to be unlearned; 2. A model is trained in an incremental way, so the data
point to be unlearned also has influence on the later data points; 3. A model that has unlearned the data tends to perform
way worse than the original model.

#### Machine Unlearning Definition (Exact/Perfect)

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/exact.png" width="80%" height="80%">

To define machine unlearning in a mathematical way, it can be defined that after the unlearning process the model
Pr(U(D,D,Df,A(D))) should have the same probability distribution as the model Pr(A(D\Df)) which represents the model 
trained on the datset without the forget set. And this is Exact Unlearning.

#### Unlearning Definition (Approximate)

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/approx.png" width="80%" height="80%">

The approximate unlearning however, lossens the constraint. It states that the unlearned model distribution should be
approximately equal to the model distribution trained on the dataset without the forget set to start with. More specifically,
this is defined as a ratio between the two models and the ration should be smaller than a predefined threshold.

#### Differential Privacy and Approximate Unlearning

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L17/app2.png" width="80%" height="80%">

There is also a close relationship between differential privacy and approximate unlearning. Differential privacy implies 
approximate unlearning however, the reverse is not true.

#### Understanding Differential Privacy and Its Role in Unlearning

![58](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/c67662e1-d1a6-4c3e-a7a6-44b0291e32d6)

Differential privacy is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset. Essentially, it provides a guarantee that the removal or addition of a single data point will not significantly affect the outcome of any analysis, thus ensuring the privacy of individuals' data. Slide 58 lays out a formal definition, encapsulating this guarantee in a mathematical inequality. It states that the probability of a specific outcome should be roughly the same, whether or not any individual data point is included in the dataset. Slide 58 also illustrates that differential privacy inherently supports a form of approximate unlearning. This is because if a model is differentially private, it’s also resilient to small changes in its dataset, which includes the removal of data points. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that a model capable of unlearning is differentially private since differential privacy requires a strict mathematical condition to be fulfilled that may not be addressed by all unlearning methods.

#### The Variants of Unlearning

![59](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/f65842fc-1e64-4001-a819-94f5fa0e62cc)

Unlearning scenarios are the specific cases in which a machine learning model is required to "forget" data. Slide 59 introduces three scenarios:

Zero-glance Unlearning: Here, the model unlearns without revisiting the forgotten data set. It relies on a subset of the remaining data and does not access the full data it's supposed to forget.

Zero-shot Unlearning: This approach aims to unlearn by approximating without any access to the forget set—the exact data to be forgotten. It is akin to removing a memory without being allowed to know what the memory is.

Few-shot Unlearning: In contrast to zero-shot, few-shot unlearning has partial access to the forget set. It uses a subset of the forget set along with the original data to recalibrate the model.

![60](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/6ddecc6b-e905-4b2a-a5eb-6932622f3237)

Slide 60 provides a more tangible perspective on these scenarios by visualizing how a model might be trained on certain data (represented by images) and how it would approach unlearning if one of those images must be forgotten. It compares how close the unlearned model is to a gold standard - a model trained without the forgotten set from the start.

#### The Framework of Unlearning

![61](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/4f00cf99-2968-49e0-85d8-0b95cd2f27b7)

Slide 61 outlines the flow of the unlearning framework, which starts with the current data being processed by a learning algorithm (like SGD or decision trees). When an unlearning request is made, the framework utilizes an unlearning algorithm which can be model-agnostic, model-intrinsic, or data-driven. The unlearned model is then produced, and verification processes like feature injection tests or membership inference attacks ensure the unlearning process is successful. If verification fails, the process might need to be repeated until the model effectively forgets the data without significantly impacting its accuracy.

#### The Mechanics of Unlearning Requests

![62](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/d7a135cc-94a6-46db-a81e-57979fd18056)
![63](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/3df70c6a-7a7c-450f-b86f-3ebcbd0f330d)

Unlearning requests can come in several forms:

Item Removal: This is a request to remove specific data points or samples, such as personal photos, from the training data of a model.

Feature Removal: Sometimes, a request is made to remove a sensitive attribute or feature from the model, like gender or race information in a job application screening system.

Task Removal: Here, the request is to have the model forget how to perform a specific task entirely. For example, if a robot is trained on multiple tasks, it might be asked to forget one of those tasks completely.

Stream Removal: In dynamic systems where data streams continuously (like online learning scenarios), users might ask for certain data to be forgotten over time, such as topics in a personalized news feed.

#### Design Requirements for Effective Unlearning

![64](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/80b07699-de6f-4ecf-aa53-1bbd66a35081)
![65](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/52bf081a-defd-4017-9a91-8719d5379740)

The design requirements for a robust unlearning system include:

Completeness: The unlearned model should behave as if the data it's unlearning was never part of the training set.

Timeliness: The unlearning process must be significantly quicker than retraining a model from scratch.

Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the remaining data should not be significantly compromised by the unlearning process.

Verifiability: There must be a verification mechanism to confirm the data has been successfully unlearned.

Model-Agnostic: The framework should be versatile enough to be applied across different model architectures and algorithms, ensuring broad applicability.

#### Unlearning Verification

![66](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/e8fe418e-8508-4899-a37f-2399f7429389)
![67](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/69d7116f-3059-4705-bd63-fdfe98c22856)

The fundamental objective of unlearning verification is to provide assurance that the unlearned model is indistinguishable from a model that was retrained from scratch without the data intended to be forgotten. Verification serves as a form of certification, validating that the unlearning process has been successful and the data has effectively been 'forgotten' by the model.

Two primary methods are described for verifying unlearning:

Feature Injection Test: This involves adding a distinctive feature to the data set to be forgotten and observing if the model's parameters adjust accordingly. If the parameters remain unchanged, the unlearning process may not have been effective.

Information Leakage and Forgetting Measurement: Here, the focus is on comparing the model's output distribution before and after unlearning to check for any information leakage. Furthermore, the success rate of privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, is used to measure how forgetful the model has been towards the removed data. A successful unlearning process should ideally show no increased success rate in such attacks.

#### Unlearning Algorithms

![68](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/68de3f0e-611f-428d-a779-09f292eb3e11)
![69](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/d86839b7-5a15-4885-8973-4f2b35bf86f9)
![70](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/148aaeaf-4fc8-45fc-84f4-60811b56d2a5)

Unlearning algorithms can be categorized into three primary types:

Model-Agnostic approaches: These treat the model as a black box, applying general techniques that are not specific to the model's architecture, such as differential privacy or statistical query learning.

Model-Intrinsic approaches: These methods utilize properties specific to certain model types. For example, linear models may unlearn by directly adjusting their weights, while deep neural networks might selectively unlearn certain neurons or layers.

Data-Driven approaches: Instead of modifying the model directly, this approach manipulates the training data. Techniques such as data partitioning allow for efficient retraining by only affecting the part of the model trained on the data to be forgotten.

#### Detail Data-Driven Approach

![71](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/54596c7e-4c92-48de-b5e0-cc85a276bdbd)
![72](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/94ac2123-fd75-4202-8b3b-651d7e33e653)

The data-driven approach involves strategies like:

Data Partitioning: Dividing the training data into smaller subsets and retraining separate sub-models for each. When unlearning is requested, only the relevant sub-models are retrained.

Data Augmentation: This involves adding noise or variations to the data to dilute the influence of individual data points, making the model less sensitive to specific instances.

Data Influence: Evaluating the influence of each data point on the model's predictions and then adjusting the training data to mitigate the impact of the points to be unlearned.

#### Evaluation Metrics

![73](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/59d50291-d67f-4837-8fe8-464acbf63ecc)

Various metrics are proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of an unlearning process, including:

Accuracy: The predictive performance of the model after unlearning.

Completeness: The indistinguishability between the outputs of the retrained and the unlearned model.

Unlearn and Relearn Time: The efficiency of the unlearning process and the time required to retrain the model.

Layer-wise and Activation Distance: Measures of difference in the model's parameters and activation outputs.

JS-Divergence and Membership Inference Attack: Metrics for evaluating the success rate of privacy attacks post-unlearning, which reflect the model's forgetfulness.

#### Unified Design Requirements

![74](https://github.com/abigfan1/2024sp-GenAI-Risk-Benefits/assets/69375710/dc93dd78-6710-4503-8db7-2e3c0635b3b5)

Slide 74 presents a comparison of unlearning methods against various design requirements and unlearning requests. It highlights that different approaches may be better suited for different unlearning scenarios, emphasizing the need for a unified design that accommodates various methods. For instance, model-agnostic approaches may support feature and item removal well but may not be the best for task removal. On the other hand, data-driven approaches can be more flexible across different unlearning requests.
